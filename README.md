# TextMining - AuTexTification_Code
## Authors: Pau Ros & Christian Molina
With the AuTexTification task we aim to boost research on the detection of text generated automatically by text generation models. 
In this task, participants must develop models that exploit clues about linguistic form and meaning to distinguish automatically generated text from human text. 
We considered five different domains including legal documents, how-to articles and social media to cover a wide variety of writing styles: from more structured and formal to less structured and informal. 
For each language, English and Spanish, the shared task will be divided into two subtasks 

##Subtask 1: Human or Generated

Participants will be provided a text, and they will have to determine whether the text has been automatically generated or not. 
To encourage models to learn features that generalize to new writing styles, three domains will be used for training, and two different domains for testing.

##Subtask 2: Model Attribution

Participants will be provided an automatically generated text, and they will have to determine what model generated it.
